# SDK Development

:warning: **status**: draft

## Introduction

The SDKs for NEM2, aka Catapult, have a set of desired properties cross languages like:

- **Provide an abstraction layer of NEM2** handling the underlying complexity and providing an easy to use SDK.
- **Reduce code duplication** of NEM2 Libraries and Applications.
- **Shared design cross languages** enabling code portability from one platform to another faster and shared knowledge between NEM Developers
- **Be Lightweight**, focusing on the minimum features required to develop in NEM2.

In order to accomplish those properties, we share this guideline to help NEM Developer Community that wants to collaborate to match the best quality with the less effort in a collaborative way.
